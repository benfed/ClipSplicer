# ClipSplicer
Prototype combining up to three video clips on the command line.

## How to run

* Build and run from the command line: `% ClipSplicer path/to/video1.mov path/to/video2.mov path/to/video3.move`
  * `% ClipSplicer --help` might be somewhat useful, but as an CLI this prototype is not quite there, yet. :)
* Edit `ClipSplicer` scheme and add video paths in _Run > Arguments Passed on Launch_, then build and run from within Xcode.

Take a look at the console output to find your output file.

## Notes

Built, run and tested on macOS 13.0 with Xcode 14.0.1.
